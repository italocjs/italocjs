## Who am i:
Hey there, welcome!
I'm Italo, an entrepreneur and engineer with a passion for creating smart IoT solutions. Throughout my career, I have played a direct role in developing over 20 products and projects in diverse industries such as additive manufacturing, health/research, forestry, civil construction, and field operations management.

Iâ€™m currently R&D leader at "Simova Tecnologia", where i am focused on assessing and improving the company's processes and technologies for field and fleet operations in the construction, forestry, and mining sectors. I evaluate on the market solutions, seeking high-quality products and technologies from reputable vendors to enhance our services. When suitable options are not available, I leverage my experience to develop, prototype and facilitate international production of customized solutions. By staying current on industry trends and collaborating with stakeholders, I drive innovation and international relations to help ensure our company remains competitive.

In 2017, I founded 3D Tecnologia, a company dedicated to providing additive manufacturing solutions. Additionally, in 2019, I successfully completed the Nexus Growth program at the Nexus incubator, recognized as one of the top five startup incubators globally. During my time at 3D Tecnologia until 2021, I played a pivotal role in directly developing and launching four market-ready products. 

With my experience and expertise, I am equipped to provide consulting services in areas such as innovation and customized product solutions. Please let me know how I can assist you further.
